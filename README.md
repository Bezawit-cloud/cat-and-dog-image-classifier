
# 🐾 Cat vs Dog Classifier  

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** based image classifier that predicts whether an uploaded image is of a **cat 🐱** or a **dog 🐶**.  
The model was trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**, and deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy, interactive use.

## 📖 Project Overview  

- Designed and trained a **CNN model** to classify images as cats or dogs.  
- Preprocessed images (resizing, scaling pixel values).  
- Trained the model on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images.  
- Saved the trained model as `.h5` and hosted it on **Google Drive**.  
- Integrated the model into a **Streamlit web app**, which downloads the model using `gdown`.  
- Deployed the application on **Streamlit Cloud**.
